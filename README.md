# Math studies applied to Python

A great data scientist should have solid foundations in Math and Statistics. So why not start getting better at it today? Once again, I created this repo to make myself accountable and put my efforts into grasping the hard concepts and turning theory to practice.

## What's the approach?

I intend to study a curriculum ranging from high school to university. This project will be organized into folders containing notebooks, resources I found useful, exercises and programming practice related to what's being learned.

## Join me!

Want to contribute to this project? Add your own resources and anotations, practice the existing exercises and let's explore the joy of really understanding Math!
